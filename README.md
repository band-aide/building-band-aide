## What is Band-Aide?
Band-Aide makes being in or managing a DIY band easier.  Itâ€™s meant to be useful and fun.  

Band-Aide is built on top of open-source technologies by musicians, for musicians. 

If we build Band-Aide, they will come. If they need a feature, they can help build it. They being us. We being everyone. 

## Building Band-Aide

Weekly Twitch stream on [twitch.tv/ibmdeveloper](https://twitch.tv/ibmdeveloper) at 1pm ET on Mondays

## Core
- **API** (Catalog? Universe? All the Things?)
	- users
	- profiles (usually the same as the user, but user can have more than one)
	- artists
	- albums
	- tracks (for collaborate; for albums?)
	- labels
	- shows
	- venues
	- stuff (for Trading Post? for merch?)
	- posters (for shows, for sale, for art/display)

see [data.md]()


## Features
- **Collaborate** (share Soundcloud tracks with collaboration requests)
- **Inspirado** (inspiration api: random song, song description, song part descriptions glued together, oblique strategies, random art)
- **Trading Post** (buy, sell, trade)
- **Messaging** (could be core to some features: Collaborate, Trading Post; could even be abstracted to Tour Spiel, thinking about a Feed feature)
- **Audio Player** (embeddable audio player)

### Post-pandemic features
- **Tour Planner** (map, travel times, fuel costs, weather alerts, etc)
- **Tour Spiel** (short updates, long diaries, and everything in-between)
- **Tour Reviews** (clubs, diners, motels, parks, etc)
- **EPK** (electronic press kit; could be mini site including feed (see below))
